Welcome to the Airline Data Analysis project! This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of airline data using a combination of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Hugging Face Transformer models. Our aim is to predict and analyze various aspects of airline operations, such as passenger satisfaction, flight delays, and more.

### Data

The Twitter Airline Sentiment dataset consisting of approximately 14,640 tweets about six major U.S. airlines, collected during February 2015. The tweets have been classified into three sentiment categories: positive, negative, and neutral.

### Introduction

In this project, we utilize the power of Machine Learning and Deep Learning Models.  LSTM and Hugging Face Transformer models to analyze airline data. LSTM networks are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that can capture long-term dependencies in sequential data. Hugging Face provides state-of-the-art pre-trained transformer models for various natural language processing tasks. By combining these two approaches, we aim to provide accurate predictions and valuable insights into airline operations.
