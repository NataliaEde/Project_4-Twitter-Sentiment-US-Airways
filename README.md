Welcome to my project on airline sentiment analysis. In this project, I aim to analyze tweets about various airlines to gain valuable insights into customer sentiment, with the goal of helping airlines improve their services and enhance customer satisfaction. Along with machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest, XGBoost, and GaussianNB, I also used Hugging Face's  NLP tools and an LSTM model for sentiment analysis. 

### Data

The Twitter Airline Sentiment dataset consisting of approximately 14,640 tweets about six major U.S. airlines, collected during February 2015. The tweets have been classified into three sentiment categories: positive, negative, and neutral. I narrowed down the dataset to a little over 7,000 tweets to ensure the data is balanced.

SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) was used to explain the predictions of the best-performing models, providing insights into the most important features driving sentiment classification.

Conclusion:

We explored a dataset of tweets about major airlines to perform sentiment analysis. By analyzing the top words and evaluating different models, we gained valuable insights into customer sentiment, which airlines can use to improve their services and enhance customer satisfaction. By continuing to monitor and analyze social media sentiment, airlines can stay ahead of the competition and provide an even better travel experience for their customers.
